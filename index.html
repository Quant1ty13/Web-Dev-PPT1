    <p style="color: white; background-color: black;">Good day, my name is Warleyne Casanova! Aspiring Game/Fullstack Web Developer. Since I was young, I have always been fascinated by the world of computers and how they worked. Coming from a family with tech savvy brothers, my passion for computers became even stronger growing up. Right now as I'm typing this down, I am 17 years old and an 11th Grade Student of CIIT under ICT-Programming Track. I have studied Web Development for half a year prior to enrolling in this school, and currently interested in the gaming side of development. I have already made three websites using only HTML and CSS, although two of them have been lost due to my old laptop no longer working. For the other one that has been manually created by yours truly, you shall see more as you navigate this site. Thank you very much for reading and getting to know more about me and my passion, and I hope you have a blessed day ahead of you!</p>
